## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Learning-Model-Building-And-Application.git
cd Deep-Learning-Model-Building-And-Application

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the following command to start model training:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/model_config.yaml
```
To evaluate a trained model:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model saved_models/best_model.pth
```

## Model Architectures
The repository includes implementations of:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformer-based models
- Custom architectures for specific tasks

## Datasets
Datasets used in this project include:
- MNIST, CIFAR-10 for image classification
- IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis
- Custom datasets for specific tasks

## Training
Model training configurations can be found in `configs/model_config.yaml`. Modify it to customize hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

## Evaluation
To evaluate a trained model, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model saved_models/best_model.pth
```
This will generate performance metrics and visualizations.

## Deployment
Models can be deployed using:
- Flask/FastAPI for web-based inference
- TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe
- Deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
